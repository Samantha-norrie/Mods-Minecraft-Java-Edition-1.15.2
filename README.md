# Mods-Minecraft-Java-Edition-1.15.2
A compilation of all mods I have made for Minecraft Java Edition 
for version 1.15.2 using MinecraftForge. I used Eclipe 2020-03
as my IDE of choice.

Descriptions of all mods (in alphabetical order):

BREAD BLOCK MOD:
Allows bread to be made into a block. The bread block can be 
crafted with nine loaves of bread. When broken, the bread 
block will drop nine loaves of bread. 

EMERALD ARMOR AND TOOLS MOD:
Emeralds can be used to craft armor, swords, and tools. Stronger than iron, but missing the diamond touch... a nice in-between material for everyday exploring!

HOLD HEARTS MOD:
A simple mod that allows the player to have a small heart as an 
item (found in the decorations tab). Use with a frame to add a 
little bit of love to any Minecraft home!
